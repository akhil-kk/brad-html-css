## Web Performance

**Web performance can be devided into tw0**

- Loading Performance
- Rendering Performance

### Loading Performance

Loading performance is the area of work performance optimization, focising around optimizing the delivery of assets from a server to the browser. It is concerned with the questions like

- Are file sizes low enough?
- Does the browser rceive critical assets first?
- Do we only load what we need to load.
- Is JS execution unnecessarily blocking render

### Rendering Performance

Rendering Performance focuses on optimising how the browser uses the downloaded assets to render the website and handle any subsequent interactions. It is concerned with the questions like

- How complex are CSS style calculations?
- Is JS causing unnecessary reflows.
- Are my event listeners making the page choppy.

**When measuring performance there are two types of data sets we can draw upon**

- Lab data
- Field data
